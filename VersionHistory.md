## Rubeus GUI - Version History

##### Version 0.4.0

- Usernames are no longer case sensitive when using AES encryption to request a TGT or when using the Brute Force feature
- Due to the change above, added an option to the Brute Forcer to skip the first AS-REQ without preauth if you want to speed things up but accept usernames being case sensitive 
- Added support for requesting TGTs for usernames that contain UTF8 characters
- Improved error messages when kerberoasting or AS-REP roasting

##### Version 0.3.0

- Didn't think to keep track of changes at this point
